<p>The book, published by New York-based Rodale, Inc., blends history, evolutionary biology, computational thinking and integral theory to make a case that everything we know about the world is mostly decided not by rational choice – but instead by conditioning and habit by our parents, teachers, education systems, culture, and society.</p>
<p>And thus, most people live their lives based on limiting rules and outdated beliefs about pretty much everything – love, work, money, parenting, sex, health and more – that they inherit and pass on from generation to generation.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HcqFKm2L7z0" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><em>The official book trailer for The Code of the Extraordinary Mind: Question Everything</em></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Code of the Extraordinary Mind</em> provides a 10-step revolutionary framework of powerful exercises and methods to identify, question and mentally break free from these rules and beliefs, so that readers can create their own set of personal truths to allows them the freedom to redefine happiness, purpose and success on their own terms.</p>
<p>Lakhiani, who graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of Michigan and is also a certified meditation instructor, spent the past 15 years studying various areas and experts in personal growth, to connect the learnings and design the framework.</p>
<p>The book draws knowledge from conversations and trainings that he has personally experienced with visionaries and thinkers such as Elon Musk, Sir Richard Branson, Peter Diamandis, Ken Wilber, Dean Kamen, Arianna Huffington, Michael Beckwith, Marisa Peer, Emily Fletcher and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once you discover the code, you will question your limits and realize that there are none. You can step into a new understanding of the world around you and your place in it, and find yourself operating at a new, extraordinary level in every area of your life,&#8221; said Lakhiani.</p>
<p><em>The Code of the Extraordinary Mind</em> is also inspired by his experience with running Mindvalley, a company he founded in 2003 that publishes digital programs and designs learning experiences for personal and professional growth through its online academies, apps, events and websites.</p>
<p>Lakhiani also hopes for the book to be a major contribution to his mission to revolutionise and improve education systems worldwide, which he believes neglect the importance of wellbeing, happiness, and personal growth. &#8220;We should teach and empower people to live their most extraordinary life, based on their own terms of happiness and success,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Lakhiani is a member of the XPRIZE Innovation Board and the Transformational Leadership Council. He is also the founder of A-Fest, an invite-only transformational event that gathers change-makers and visionaries from around the world to share powerful insights and techniques. Speakers that have taken the A-Fest stage include space traveller Anousheh Ansari, Google X Co-Founder Tom Chi, Academy Award-winning actress Patricia Arquette, Summit Series&#8217; Elliott Bisnow and Jefferson Award-winner Sam Beard.</p>
<p>Lakhiani himself is also a global speaker who has shared the stage with the likes of Sir Richard Branson, the 14th Dalai Lama, Tony Hsieh, Dave Logan, Stephen Covey and more.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Code of the Extraordinary Mind is also a best seller on <a href="http://projects.latimes.com/bestsellers/lists/2016/05/29/#code-extraordinary-mind">Los Angeles Times</a> and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/06/21/the-code-of-the-extraordinary-mind/2444877/isbn/9781623367084/">USA Today</a>.

<p>As we go into 2016, we made some changes designed to make your experience with the <a href="http://mindvalleyacademy.com" target="_blank">Mindvalley Academy</a> even more joyful, personalized, and transformational:</p>
<h2>Elula</h2>
<p>To improve your learning experience, we&#8217;ve spent the last 18 months investing in building a new learning platform.<a href="http://blog.mindvalleyacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CE-SVC-Tribe.jpg"><br />
</a> <a href="http://blog.mindvalleyacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/JJ-Virgin-Kitchen.jpg"><br />
</a> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5681" src="http://blog.mindvalleyacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Elula-Collection.jpg" alt="Elula Collection" width="500" height="275" /></p>
<p>Our aim was to make the courses on Mindvalley Academy easy to consume, beautiful to experience, and be available online and offline. We have already rolled out our first course on the new platform — <em><a href="http://mindvalleyacademy.com/store/consciousness-engineering/index?utm_campaign=mva-ce&amp;utm_source=cm-blog&amp;utm_medium=bodytext&amp;utm_content=new-in-2016" target="_blank">Consciousness Engineering</a></em> — and more and more of our programs will move onto it early in the year.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5677" src="http://blog.mindvalleyacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CE-on-iPhone.jpg" alt="CE on iPhone" width="500" height="333" /></p>
<p>You will also be able to download programs to your phone, speed up the audio, and much more.</p>
<h2>World class authors</h2>
<p>Every year, we have been trying to bring you the biggest names in the personal growth. This year, you&#8217;ve heard from the likes of Marissa Peer and Michael Beckwith.</p>
<p>Next year, look forward to hearing from nutrition experts like <a href="http://jjvirgin.com/" target="_blank">J.J Virgin</a>, <a href="http://psalmisadorayoga.com/" target="_blank">Psalm Isadora</a>, and <a href="http://www.andrewholecek.com/" target="_blank">Andrew Holocek</a>.</p>

<div id="attachment_8278" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-8278 size-medium" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-29-at-2.37.01-PM-300x246.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-12-29 at 2.37.01 PM" width="300" height="246" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-29-at-2.37.01-PM-300x246.png 300w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-29-at-2.37.01-PM.png 396w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Author and Spiritual Teacher, Andrew Holocek</p></div>
<div id="attachment_8279" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-8279 size-medium" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-29-at-2.36.23-PM-300x200.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-12-29 at 2.36.23 PM" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-29-at-2.36.23-PM-300x200.png 300w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-29-at-2.36.23-PM.png 934w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sex and Sensuality Coach, Psalm Isadora</p></div>
<h2>Tribelearn</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve found that the best way to learn is to learn as a group.</p>
<p>So, we decided to invest in peer-to-peer learning software, which lets you learn from other members. With every course you buy, we want you to be part of a community of people going through the same material, sharing your experiences, challenges, and revelations along the way&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://tribelearn.com" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5678" src="http://blog.mindvalleyacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Soulvana-Tribe.jpg" alt="Soulvana Tribe" width="600" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s called <a href="http://tribelearn.com/" target="_blank">Tribelearn</a> and is already available on programs like <em><a href="http://mindvalleyacademy.com/store/consciousness-engineering/index?utm_campaign=mva-ce&amp;utm_source=cm-blog&amp;utm_medium=bodytext&amp;utm_content=new-in-2016" target="_blank">Consciousness Engineering</a></em> and <em><a href="http://soulvana.com/soulvana-circle?utm_campaign=soul-soulvana-circle&amp;utm_source=cm-blog&amp;utm_medium=bodytext&amp;utm_content=new-in-2016" target="_blank">Soulvana Circle</a></em> and is rolling out soon for the rest of our programs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5679" src="http://blog.mindvalleyacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CE-SVC-Tribe.jpg" alt="CE SVC Tribe" width="599" height="300" /></p>
<h2>Channels for your interests</h2>
<p>Rather than just having one Mindvalley Academy that covers all aspects of personal growth, we&#8217;re establishing separate interest groups.</p>
<p>For example, if you&#8217;re only interested in spirituality and energy work, sign up for <em><a href="http://soulvana.com/soulvana-circle?utm_campaign=soul-soulvana-circle&amp;utm_source=cm-blog&amp;utm_medium=bodytext&amp;utm_content=new-in-2016" target="_blank">Soulvana Circle</a></em> and you&#8217;ll only be notified of Masterclasses that fit that category. If you only care about Yoga, join upcoming yoga channel, <em><a href="http://zenward.com" target="_blank">Zenward</a></em>. We&#8217;ll also be launching work and productivity.</p>
<p><a href="http://zenward.com" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5682" src="http://blog.mindvalleyacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/safe_image.jpeg" alt="safe_image" width="470" height="245" /></a></p>
<p>Also, look forward to more academies launching in niches like impact, work, and productivity.</p>
<p>As you can tell, the next 12 months are going to be very exciting, and we hope to bring you more and more innovations to truly revolutionize your learning experience with us.</p>
<p>So once again, thank you for your support as a Mindvalley member, have a wonderful New Year, and here&#8217;s hoping 2016 turns into an extraordinary year for you.</p>

Let us count the ways&#8230;</h3>
<p>One of them is definitely investing in a beautiful work space, because we believe our employees deserve an environment that inspires creativity and fuels their productivity. Also–we&#8217;re all about great design, really.</p>
<p>These are just among the many reasons we&#8217;ve become a world-class company to work for and why we were voted one of <em>Inc. Magazine</em>&#8216;s coolest offices in 2012.</p>
<p>And we recently made a 12-page feature in South East Asia&#8217;s <strong><em>Haven</em></strong> by <strong><em>The Edge</em></strong>, Malaysia and Singapore&#8217;s leading financial and investment news publication.</p>

<h1>Tapping the Human Mind</h1>
<h3>How a stretch of the imagination has produced one of the region’s most inspiring workspaces.</h3>
<p>&#8220;WITHIN Menara UOA Bangsar sits one of the most fascinating office spaces in Malaysia — that of <strong>Mindvalley</strong>, an incubator and developer of businesses that innovate on self-improvement. It is essentially a 21st-century enterprise, offering services such as <span class="knx_highlight">digital publishing</span> and the development of education technology, mobile apps, content and events, to further enhance companies that deal with self-help and motivation.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/announcements/mindvalley-is-in-haven/attachment/screen-shot-2015-09-30-at-5-16-42-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-8130"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8130" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-30-at-5.16.42-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-09-30 at 5.16.42 PM" width="1390" height="903" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-30-at-5.16.42-PM.png 1390w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-30-at-5.16.42-PM-300x195.png 300w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-30-at-5.16.42-PM-1024x665.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1390px) 100vw, 1390px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Founder and CEO Vishen Lakhiani</strong> established the company in 2005, working out of a house with a team of seven. Today, the company is 200-strong, comprising more than 35 nationalities, whom its leader describes as innovators, artists, technologists and dreamers. Vishen is seen as a pioneer who uses talent branding and “consciousness engineering” to groom and attract talent, and has invested money and time to create a workplace that reflects these philosophies and inspires its inhabitants.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8146" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-i.jpeg" alt="MV HQ 29 i" width="1200" height="777" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-i.jpeg 1200w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-i-300x194.jpeg 300w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-i-1024x663.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>On its website, the company is described as a provider of “self-improvement for the mobile generation”. The mission statement: “We believe that extraordinary is an aspiration instilled within each and every one of us. We just need to be encouraged to unleash that potential, so we can eliminate limiting beliefs that are hindering us from pursuing our dreams and adopt a powerful mindset that unlocks a life that we are truly capable of living.” This goal takes its cue from a philosophy by scientist and futurist, Buckminster Fuller, who said, “You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”</p>
<p>As the company grew, Vishen decided it was time to invest in a proper headquarters. The company had been recognised as WorldBlu’s Most Democratic Workplaces from 2008 onwards and needed the space that reflected that. Having found 6,000 sq ft at Menara UOA Bangsar, he engaged <strong>PDI Design + Associates</strong> to help realise his vision.</p>
<p>PDI designer Ian Lee says, “Vishen wanted the space to reflect the company’s values and beliefs, and its diversity. One of its core values is: Happiness is the new productivity. You can see bright colours, as well as superhero references, all incorporated into the spaces to encourage that.</p>
<p>“Vishen started his company at a time when Malaysia was suffering from brain drain, and Vishen wanted to create a company that could reverse this process. He wanted to attract people from overseas here. And when he came to PDI, he said, ‘Hey, I’ve got this problem; now you have the free hand to solve it’.</p>
<p>“PDI is unique in that we use Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) in our interior design, and it was through the Mindvalley project that we really delved into interior spaces that communicate with the subconscious. It involves the study of body language, how the mind works, the subconscious, and how to connect with generations X, Y and Z. There are colours and shapes, which are basic ID, but we also look at how to encourage people to use the space, how to make them walk a certain pathway, and how to create spaces where people can come together or ‘accidentally’ meet so they can talk, share and exchange ideas.”</p>
<p>The experiment, led by PDI managing partner Tan Sucheng, was completed in 2010. Beautiful, modern and timeless, it boasts open communal spaces, organic layouts and textures interspersed with sci-fi shapes and bright, solid colours. An almost life-size figurine of Wonder Woman, the unofficial Mindvalley mascot, stands tall in the reception area. Superheroes are a symbol of empowerment, where people step up to do great, extraordinary things, and you’ll find plenty of references to them throughout Mindvalley’s various spaces, be it in the murals on the walls or random words of inspiration. Wonder Woman is the most celebrated because a majority of the staff is female — the company is powered by females, in fact.</p>
<p>In 2012, Vishen came calling at PDI again, as Mindvalley was expanding. This time, Lee took the lead in design, with Vishen’s blessings to take it up a notch. The result was Level 29, also known as the <strong>Hall of Awesomeness</strong>. At first sight, it is obvious that this is quite a quantum leap from the first phase.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8124" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29d.jpg" alt="MVHQ29d" width="1200" height="800" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29d.jpg 1200w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29d-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29d-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>The idea was to build on a town hall kind of atmosphere, with a lot of collaborative spaces. When this space was launched, so was Mindvalley’s new, updated logo — a pair of wings, a symbol of empowerment. Set up against the wall at the entrance, where there is a waiting area with five white cubist stools, the wings are placed in a way so visitors can take fun pictures in which they look like they have wings.</p>
<p>Turn right, and you’re greeted by a set of honeycomb shelves — busy as a bee, the unity of a hive, it’s really up to your interpretation. On the shelves are various comic superhero figurines and paraphernalia. A gorgeous work of art of Muhammad Ali, signed by the artist and the subject from the CEO’s personal collection, takes pride of place on the wall opposite the shelves. Moving along, there’s a small pantry with a French theme (complete with a black-and-white tiled floor) to the right and a window-side banquette upholstered with Astro Turf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8144 size-large" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-g-683x1024.jpg" alt="MV HQ 29 g" width="683" height="1024" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-g-683x1024.jpg 683w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-g-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-g.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></p>
<p>Around the corner, you’ll find the workspace — a cluster of work desks to the right, an open area with a big white tree and Astro Turf on the floor, where people can sit on the “grass” if they wanted. There’s a tree house up a ladder for a cosy gathering of the minds; beneath it are four cubicles with sound-dampening walls, for groups of up to four to convene or for individuals looking for a more private space to work. Some offer seating, some offer high tables for those who prefer to work on their feet. Opposite these is the Jedi room, where the seating is inspired by the <span class="knx_highlight">Jedi Council</span> in Star Wars.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8143" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-f.jpg" alt="MV HQ 29 f" width="1200" height="800" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-f.jpg 1200w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-f-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-f-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8123" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29c.jpg" alt="MVHQ29c" width="1200" height="800" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29c.jpg 1200w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29c-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29c-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>At the heart is the Hall of Awesomeness, an auditorium with a capacity for 150 guests with a speaker stage, customisable seating with beanbags, a built-in sound system, a backstage room and a kitchen space for catering. Every week, a variety of events and meet-ups are held because, Vishen believes, “When smart people come together, they multiply each other’s potential.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8122" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29b.jpg" alt="MVHQ29b" width="1200" height="800" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29b.jpg 1200w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29b-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29b-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8145" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-h.jpeg" alt="MV HQ 29 h" width="1200" height="800" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-h.jpeg 1200w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-h-300x200.jpeg 300w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-h-1024x683.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Free form would be the best way to describe the layout of Level 29. The design enables the employees to sit and work however, wherever and whenever they want.</p>
<p>Says Lee, “To me, it’s a space where even if you’re shy, you can still get around it. But to make full use of the space, one has to completely let go of one’s ego and inhibitions. It’s a very social space. Even if you’re an introvert, it could encourage you to come out of your shell a little bit too.”</p>
<p>Six months ago, the third phase of Mindvalley’s spatial expansion was completed. This project, although smaller than the first two phases, is a little bit more dramatic in its look and feel. When meeting with Vishen, PDI designers always ask, “What’s the big plan this time?”</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8151 size-large" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-35-j-683x1024.jpg" alt="MV HQ 35 j" width="683" height="1024" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-35-j-683x1024.jpg 683w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-35-j-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-35-j.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></p>
<p>The new space was for the IT and tech team, 25 people in all. Vishen’s request this time was more of a theme than a concept — steampunk, the sci-fi subculture that incorporates technology and aesthetics from 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery. Think of Jules Verne’s epic tales and Alan Moore’s League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Originally nicknamed Nautilus Chamber, the tech department is visually stunning</p>

<p>Walk through its main doors on the 35th floor of Menara UOA Bangsar and you’re transported to another place and time, it is almost like a movie set. Lee says he took quite a lot of cues from the video game BioShock Infinite. The steampunk palette is brown leather, bronze, copper and steel pipe. The counter in the pantry is made with concrete bricks and matched with wooden cabinets with steel trimmings finished in a rose gold tint. The feature wall that separates the workstations from a small conference room is a magnificent piece of metalwork, custom-made based on a sketch by Lee. It is a skeletal outline of a pirate ship, a sea monster, a submarine — basically, images that look like they had come straight out of a Jules Verne novel. Perpendicular to this is another centrepiece — a world map that doubles as a whiteboard.</p>

<p>Lamps were specially ordered from Machine Age Lamps, a company that specialises in turning scrap into sculptural lighting. On a trip to Europe, Vishen found time to shop for steampunk paraphernalia, including leather goggles that now serve as props in a meeting room. A mannequin dressed in theme stands in the conference space as part of the décor.</p>

<p>“As a client, Vishen is extremely dedicated, and we look forward to working with him every time,” says Lee. “Every time I come back to Mindvalley, I see how the space has evolved, in terms of how the staff use and decorate it. It is a diverse work environment, and with so many cultures here, you have a multitude of expressions that imprint themselves on the blank canvas we’ve provided. It’s great to see how they interact with the space, and the change has been really organic. Mindvalley’s spaces enable the people actually using them to dictate how they want to use them.”</p>
<p>Mindvalley remains a <strong>WorldBlu-certified Most Democratic Workplaces</strong>, one of <strong>Inc. magazine’s World’s Coolest Offices</strong>, and is endorsed by the <span class="knx_highlight">US-based <strong>Great Place To Work Institute</strong></span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mindvalley&#8217;s charm is more than its design though. It&#8217;s the people who work here. And we&#8217;re always hiring.</p>

<p>Following the success of its pioneering academy for personal growth, Mindvalley Academy, Mindvalley recognises the growing niche of modern spiritualists worldwide, as well as the Spiritual But Not Religious (SBNR) audience, who are seeking an alternative approach to their wellbeing and relationships, in order to lead a life of deeper purpose and meaning.</p>

<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_MiE5rjdtqc" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The video, which has collectively garnered over 80,000 views, 3500 shares and 350 comments from viewers worldwide in just 1 week, features host Asha Gill and Mindvalley founder Vishen Lakhiani as they invite spiritual enthuasiasts around the world to share their vision on a global spiritual awakening, and draw inspiration from minds and philosophers such as Ken Wilber, Lao Tzu, Albert Einstein and more.</p>
<p>While customers are able to purchase courses and products individually on Soulvana, the academy&#8217;s main feature is its membership program, the Soulvana Circle. For a fixed monthly fee, members of the Soulvana Cirle will have access to a new course every month, discover key insights from selected spiritual teachers from the Soulvana portfolio, become part of a private community and support system of fellow soul-seekers to engage, interact and grow with, as guided by host Asha Gill.</p>

<p>The incomparable beauty of its landscape (ranging from tropical forests, mountains with waterfalls to sun-splashed beaches), its perfect climate, and unspoiled nature have made Guanacaste one of the most visited areas in Costa Rica.</p>
<p>The event will take place from October 22nd to October 25th, in the beautiful and remote Westin Playa Conchal Resort — an all inclusive eco-friendly retreat located between the exotic forests and perfect beaches.</p>
<p>Awesomeness Fest is an invite-only transformational event that brings together an extraordinary community of change-makers and visionaries in an exotic location to make connections and undergo a powerful training. The program is designed to teach you how to bring out the most of your capabilities as a human being – the kind of knowledge you wished they had taught you in school.</p>
<p>The theme of this event will be&#8230; Belief Hacking.</p>
<p>Your beliefs around business, health, relationships, and other aspects of your life shape your perception of your world. When you drop outdated beliefs that no longer serve you and replace them with better, fulfilling ones… your world will start to shift for the better.</p>
<p>Applications are now open to join us for four unforgettable days at an event that 90% of attendees call one of the — if not THE — best experience of their lives.</p>
<p>Slots are limited, and they’re being snapped up fast. So apply today to secure YOUR spot at Awesomeness Fest 2015 Costa Rica.</p>

<h3>Held on May 7th-8th 2015 at Terranea Resort in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, the annual XPRIZE Trustees&#8217; Visioneering gathered 150 corporate leaders, philanthropists, journalists and thinkers to discuss and debate the grand challenges faced by humanity and conceptualize the next XPRIZE prize to adress and solve the winning issue.</h3>
<p>Every year the XPRIZE Foundation organizes a highly leveraged, incentivized prize competition that pushes the limits of what’s possible to change the world for the better. The winning XPRIZE idea will lead to hundreds of millions of dollars going into innovations to solve massive world problem.</p>
<p>Previous XPRIZE competitions include a challenge to developing a self-guided education platform to teach kids how to rea and do math, which was funded for US$15 million by Elon Musk; and the Ansari X Prize in 2004, intended to inspire research and development into technology for space exploration.</p>
<p>This year, the topics explored at the visioneering event focused on the future of five key areas: Home, Mind, Food, Health and Work. Teams were formed to conceptualize and pitch their ideas to the judges, which consisted of XPRIZE Foundation and Singularity University co-founder Peter Diamandis, renowned scientist, entrepreneur and author Astro Teller, and Chief Technology &amp; Strategy Officer of Cisco Systems, Padma Warrior.</p>
<p>The winning pitch for 2015 was the &#8220;Human Dignity&#8221; XPRIZE, conceptualized by Vishen Lakhiani, founder of Mindvalley, Jessica Banks, founder of robotic furniture company RockPaperRobot, Jonathan Knowles, senior advisor at Autodesk, and Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker Christina Weiss Lurie. The &#8220;Human Dignity&#8221; XPRIZE aims to revolutionize refugee housing by making it cheaper and more durable, with sustainable and groundbreaking technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are 80 million forcefully displaced people around the world today. Some are refugees displaced because of war. Others, because of economic downturn, ethnic riots and natural disasters &#8211; like the recent earthquake in Nepal and the displacement of the Rohingya community. Every day, 32,000 more people are displaced. If all the displaced people in the world today were gathered you would have the 26th largest country in the world. We aren&#8217;t doing enough,&#8221; urged Vishen Lakhiani, whose company mission is to inspire 1 billion people worldwide to live extraordinary lives through personal growth education and positive impact.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world needs to pay more attention to the refugees,&#8221; he added. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we call it the Human Dignity XPRIZE. The challenge is to develop a scalable, instantly deployable, and self-sustainable community infrastructure so refugee camps and slums can be turned into functional townships – think a pack-and-go housing solution that provides efficient water, electricity, and sanitation, have a lifespan of at least six months, and can be adaptable to multi-terrain and climate conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Human Dignity concept will get an ideation workshop at XPRIZE to determine if the prize is feasible and will have the intended impact.</p>

<p>Please be warned that we’re having a problem with scammers claiming to be co-founders of Mindvalley.</p>
<p>People who are identified themselves as Melissa Logan and Paul Vade (in few cases also as Lisa Beckum and Amanda Joseph) have been using <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">Upwork</a> (former oDesk) and <a href="https://www.elance.com/">Elance</a> as a platform to scam a number of individuals into writing articles and blog posts and failing to pay them.</p>
<h2>Please avoid any contact with anyone working under these aliases.<img class="  wp-image-8066 aligncenter" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/scam-alert-1024x788-300x231.png" alt="scam-alert-1024x788" width="375" height="289" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/scam-alert-1024x788-300x231.png 300w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/scam-alert-1024x788.png 1024w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/scam-alert-1024x788-622x479.png 622w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></h2>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">These people are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NOT</strong></span> acting on behalf of Mindvalley, have <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NO</strong></span> connection to Mindvalley and have <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NO</strong></span> right to use the Mindvalley brand for their scams.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The scam typically works like this: they advertise for writers on platforms like Upwork (former oDesk) or Elance, ask to move the conversation to Skype in order to &#8220;avoid the fees&#8221; charged by the platform, and refuse to pay once the work is complete.</span></p>
<p>Mindvalley and Cecilia Sardeo, the co-founder of Midvalley Italy (scammers have been using her identity as well), do not have <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>any</strong></span> connection to Melissa Logan, Paul Vade, Lisa Beckum and Amanda Joseph.</p>
<p>We are working to find those acting on behalf of Mindvalley without any rights to do so.</p>
<p>We are very sorry for any inconveniences caused by this matter.</p>
<p>Any updates will be posted here (last updated Sept 8th).</p>
