<p>One of them is definitely investing in a beautiful work space, because we believe our employees deserve an environment that inspires creativity and fuels their productivity. Also–we&#8217;re all about great design, really.</p>
<p>These are just among the many reasons we&#8217;ve become a world-class company to work for and why we were voted one of <em>Inc. Magazine</em>&#8216;s coolest offices in 2012.</p>
<p>And we recently made a 12-page feature in South East Asia&#8217;s <strong><em>Haven</em></strong> by <strong><em>The Edge</em></strong>, Malaysia and Singapore&#8217;s leading financial and investment news publication.</p>

<h1>Tapping the Human Mind</h1>
<h3>How a stretch of the imagination has produced one of the region’s most inspiring workspaces.</h3>
<p>&#8220;WITHIN Menara UOA Bangsar sits one of the most fascinating office spaces in Malaysia — that of <strong>Mindvalley</strong>, an incubator and developer of businesses that innovate on self-improvement. It is essentially a 21st-century enterprise, offering services such as <span class="knx_highlight">digital publishing</span> and the development of education technology, mobile apps, content and events, to further enhance companies that deal with self-help and motivation.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/announcements/mindvalley-is-in-haven/attachment/screen-shot-2015-09-30-at-5-16-42-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-8130"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8130" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-30-at-5.16.42-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-09-30 at 5.16.42 PM" width="1390" height="903" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-30-at-5.16.42-PM.png 1390w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-30-at-5.16.42-PM-300x195.png 300w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-30-at-5.16.42-PM-1024x665.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1390px) 100vw, 1390px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Founder and CEO Vishen Lakhiani</strong> established the company in 2005, working out of a house with a team of seven. Today, the company is 200-strong, comprising more than 35 nationalities, whom its leader describes as innovators, artists, technologists and dreamers. Vishen is seen as a pioneer who uses talent branding and “consciousness engineering” to groom and attract talent, and has invested money and time to create a workplace that reflects these philosophies and inspires its inhabitants.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8146" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-i.jpeg" alt="MV HQ 29 i" width="1200" height="777" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-i.jpeg 1200w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-i-300x194.jpeg 300w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-i-1024x663.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>On its website, the company is described as a provider of “self-improvement for the mobile generation”. The mission statement: “We believe that extraordinary is an aspiration instilled within each and every one of us. We just need to be encouraged to unleash that potential, so we can eliminate limiting beliefs that are hindering us from pursuing our dreams and adopt a powerful mindset that unlocks a life that we are truly capable of living.” This goal takes its cue from a philosophy by scientist and futurist, Buckminster Fuller, who said, “You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”</p>
<p>As the company grew, Vishen decided it was time to invest in a proper headquarters. The company had been recognised as WorldBlu’s Most Democratic Workplaces from 2008 onwards and needed the space that reflected that. Having found 6,000 sq ft at Menara UOA Bangsar, he engaged <strong>PDI Design + Associates</strong> to help realise his vision.</p>
<p>PDI designer Ian Lee says, “Vishen wanted the space to reflect the company’s values and beliefs, and its diversity. One of its core values is: Happiness is the new productivity. You can see bright colours, as well as superhero references, all incorporated into the spaces to encourage that.</p>
<p>“Vishen started his company at a time when Malaysia was suffering from brain drain, and Vishen wanted to create a company that could reverse this process. He wanted to attract people from overseas here. And when he came to PDI, he said, ‘Hey, I’ve got this problem; now you have the free hand to solve it’.</p>
<p>“PDI is unique in that we use Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) in our interior design, and it was through the Mindvalley project that we really delved into interior spaces that communicate with the subconscious. It involves the study of body language, how the mind works, the subconscious, and how to connect with generations X, Y and Z. There are colours and shapes, which are basic ID, but we also look at how to encourage people to use the space, how to make them walk a certain pathway, and how to create spaces where people can come together or ‘accidentally’ meet so they can talk, share and exchange ideas.”</p>
<p>The experiment, led by PDI managing partner Tan Sucheng, was completed in 2010. Beautiful, modern and timeless, it boasts open communal spaces, organic layouts and textures interspersed with sci-fi shapes and bright, solid colours. An almost life-size figurine of Wonder Woman, the unofficial Mindvalley mascot, stands tall in the reception area. Superheroes are a symbol of empowerment, where people step up to do great, extraordinary things, and you’ll find plenty of references to them throughout Mindvalley’s various spaces, be it in the murals on the walls or random words of inspiration. Wonder Woman is the most celebrated because a majority of the staff is female — the company is powered by females, in fact.</p>
<p>In 2012, Vishen came calling at PDI again, as Mindvalley was expanding. This time, Lee took the lead in design, with Vishen’s blessings to take it up a notch. The result was Level 29, also known as the <strong>Hall of Awesomeness</strong>. At first sight, it is obvious that this is quite a quantum leap from the first phase.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8124" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29d.jpg" alt="MVHQ29d" width="1200" height="800" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29d.jpg 1200w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29d-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29d-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>The idea was to build on a town hall kind of atmosphere, with a lot of collaborative spaces. When this space was launched, so was Mindvalley’s new, updated logo — a pair of wings, a symbol of empowerment. Set up against the wall at the entrance, where there is a waiting area with five white cubist stools, the wings are placed in a way so visitors can take fun pictures in which they look like they have wings.</p>
<p>Turn right, and you’re greeted by a set of honeycomb shelves — busy as a bee, the unity of a hive, it’s really up to your interpretation. On the shelves are various comic superhero figurines and paraphernalia. A gorgeous work of art of Muhammad Ali, signed by the artist and the subject from the CEO’s personal collection, takes pride of place on the wall opposite the shelves. Moving along, there’s a small pantry with a French theme (complete with a black-and-white tiled floor) to the right and a window-side banquette upholstered with Astro Turf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8144 size-large" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-g-683x1024.jpg" alt="MV HQ 29 g" width="683" height="1024" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-g-683x1024.jpg 683w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-g-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-g.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></p>
<p>Around the corner, you’ll find the workspace — a cluster of work desks to the right, an open area with a big white tree and Astro Turf on the floor, where people can sit on the “grass” if they wanted. There’s a tree house up a ladder for a cosy gathering of the minds; beneath it are four cubicles with sound-dampening walls, for groups of up to four to convene or for individuals looking for a more private space to work. Some offer seating, some offer high tables for those who prefer to work on their feet. Opposite these is the Jedi room, where the seating is inspired by the <span class="knx_highlight">Jedi Council</span> in Star Wars.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8143" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-f.jpg" alt="MV HQ 29 f" width="1200" height="800" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-f.jpg 1200w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-f-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-f-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8123" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29c.jpg" alt="MVHQ29c" width="1200" height="800" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29c.jpg 1200w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29c-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29c-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>At the heart is the Hall of Awesomeness, an auditorium with a capacity for 150 guests with a speaker stage, customisable seating with beanbags, a built-in sound system, a backstage room and a kitchen space for catering. Every week, a variety of events and meet-ups are held because, Vishen believes, “When smart people come together, they multiply each other’s potential.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8122" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29b.jpg" alt="MVHQ29b" width="1200" height="800" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29b.jpg 1200w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29b-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MVHQ29b-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8145" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-h.jpeg" alt="MV HQ 29 h" width="1200" height="800" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-h.jpeg 1200w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-h-300x200.jpeg 300w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-29-h-1024x683.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Free form would be the best way to describe the layout of Level 29. The design enables the employees to sit and work however, wherever and whenever they want.</p>
<p>Says Lee, “To me, it’s a space where even if you’re shy, you can still get around it. But to make full use of the space, one has to completely let go of one’s ego and inhibitions. It’s a very social space. Even if you’re an introvert, it could encourage you to come out of your shell a little bit too.”</p>
<p>Six months ago, the third phase of Mindvalley’s spatial expansion was completed. This project, although smaller than the first two phases, is a little bit more dramatic in its look and feel. When meeting with Vishen, PDI designers always ask, “What’s the big plan this time?”</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8151 size-large" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-35-j-683x1024.jpg" alt="MV HQ 35 j" width="683" height="1024" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-35-j-683x1024.jpg 683w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-35-j-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MV-HQ-35-j.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></p>
<p>The new space was for the IT and tech team, 25 people in all. Vishen’s request this time was more of a theme than a concept — steampunk, the sci-fi subculture that incorporates technology and aesthetics from 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery. Think of Jules Verne’s epic tales and Alan Moore’s League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Originally nicknamed Nautilus Chamber, the tech department is visually stunning</p>

<p>Walk through its main doors on the 35th floor of Menara UOA Bangsar and you’re transported to another place and time, it is almost like a movie set. Lee says he took quite a lot of cues from the video game BioShock Infinite. The steampunk palette is brown leather, bronze, copper and steel pipe. The counter in the pantry is made with concrete bricks and matched with wooden cabinets with steel trimmings finished in a rose gold tint. The feature wall that separates the workstations from a small conference room is a magnificent piece of metalwork, custom-made based on a sketch by Lee. It is a skeletal outline of a pirate ship, a sea monster, a submarine — basically, images that look like they had come straight out of a Jules Verne novel. Perpendicular to this is another centrepiece — a world map that doubles as a whiteboard.</p>

<p>Lamps were specially ordered from Machine Age Lamps, a company that specialises in turning scrap into sculptural lighting. On a trip to Europe, Vishen found time to shop for steampunk paraphernalia, including leather goggles that now serve as props in a meeting room. A mannequin dressed in theme stands in the conference space as part of the décor.</p>

<p>“As a client, Vishen is extremely dedicated, and we look forward to working with him every time,” says Lee. “Every time I come back to Mindvalley, I see how the space has evolved, in terms of how the staff use and decorate it. It is a diverse work environment, and with so many cultures here, you have a multitude of expressions that imprint themselves on the blank canvas we’ve provided. It’s great to see how they interact with the space, and the change has been really organic. Mindvalley’s spaces enable the people actually using them to dictate how they want to use them.”</p>
<p>Mindvalley remains a <strong>WorldBlu-certified Most Democratic Workplaces</strong>, one of <strong>Inc. magazine’s World’s Coolest Offices</strong>, and is endorsed by the <span class="knx_highlight">US-based <strong>Great Place To Work Institute</strong></span>.&#8221;</p>

<h4 class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1"><i>“Mindvalley is a bit of a cultural anomaly. Based on the way we think the world should work, Mindvalley shouldn’t exist. It doesn’t make any sense.”</i></span></h4>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Malaysia is a country suffering from massive brain drain. Every year it loses 1% of it’s population to more developed countries like the USA, Canada, Hong Kong or Australia. Vishen was born in Malaysia and has watched the majority of his friends from high school leave Malaysia for richer countries. One of his goals is to end this loss of talent. His plan? Creating the World’s Single Greatest Workplace right here in Malaysia and changing the way the world and Malaysians view the country.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h4 class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span class="s1">“I’m a big fan of the idea that what you believe comes true about the world and about your reality. So I decided to created a new vision and belief. And that vision was: ‘I am going to build the best damn place to work. Not in Malaysia, but on the planet. And it’s going to be right here in Kuala Lumpur. Screw Brain Drain.”’</span></em></strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this speech Vishen shares the principles he brought into Mindvalley to transform it into one of the world’s best places to work — his vision, notions of work space and culture, happiness at work, and how to attract brilliant employees. This has resulted in the company, although based in Malaysia, dominating it’s industry globally, growing by 80% every year for the last 5 years, and becoming a talent hub now employing people from 30 different countries, all of whom move to Malaysia to work from Mindvalley HQ.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h4 class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1"><i>“We spend 70% of your working hours at work… So why shouldn’t work be the happiest, most fulfilling, most celebratory, most enticing times of your life? That’s what we owe the human population. And that’s why a massive work revolution in corporate companies, start-ups and government is necessary.”</i></span></h4>

<p>But it is also a time for gratitude. To appreciate the simpler things in life: Health. Family. Loved Ones. Comfort. Humanity. Food on the table.</p>
<p>Seven percent of Mindvalley employees are Muslims, and this year many of our foreign team members were able to experience the Ramadan festivity with them. We also had a fast-breaking dinner at our HQ as part of our cultural celebration.</p>
<p>So we decided to record the event and interview some of our Muslim co-workers as well as some observers of the tradition on what it means to them.</p>
<p><strong>On behalf of the international Mindvalley family, we&#8217;d like to thank and wish everyone a great Eid, and hoped you had a happy Ramadan :-)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>How can tattoos STILL be taboo in the workplace?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Pew Research Center found that 42% of people feel visible <em>tattoos are always inappropriate at work</em> and 39% said that employees with tattoos and piercings <em>reflect poorly on their employers</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Well, we believe ALL art is a positive, no matter the form or the reasons.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So, to challenge the stigma of tattoos in the workplace, we decided to celebrate our &#8220;inked&#8221; employees, the beauty of the art form, and the humility of the stories behind them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Seriously</em> guys &#8211; get with the times.</p>

I chose this dragon to remind me that it&#8217;s time to own my strength. <strong>Indian hands with bangles holding a lotus flower:</strong> growing up, I was very detached from gender and race until my mid-20s. I started to appreciate my story, including that of my ethnicity and femininity. The bangles symbolise my heritage and the lotus flower reminds me that we can all turn out awesome regardless of the circumstances.<strong>Buddha cloud:</strong>I was going deep into my spiritual practice in my late 20s and was tailoring my own concept for &#8220;a way of life&#8221;. Buddism and Sikhism were the first explorations, so to commemorate my journey I got the cloud, which is from a picture I saw of Buddha sitting on a cloud. <strong>Negative space stars:</strong>My father got a tattoo of a star on his right thigh for 10 cents in 1951 at a fun fare. As a little girl, I loved this story and added the stars to remind me of my father and the amazing stories he tells. It was also a symbol to always aim for the sky, and to shine on others</p></div>

We&#8217;re calling all companies and businesses to join us and watch how this will change their company culture in remarkable ways.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Mindvalley decided that Valentine’s Day shouldn’t just be a day just for lovers with lovers – it should be an entire WEEK where everybody gets to experience a little love and appreciation at the workplace. After all, love and appreciation lead to happiness. And happiness is known to boost productivity.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I first started up Mindvalley, I&#8217;d always dabble in different techniques to boost productivity in the workplace,&#8221; says founder Vishen Lakhiani. &#8220;But if there is just ONE thing that I discovered creates consistent leaps in productivity, it&#8217;s this – your level of happiness at work.&#8221;</p>
<p>So why shouldn&#8217;t work be filled with happiness? Mindvalley started a little experiment that completely surpassed their expectations, proving just how much human beings can truly care for each other when &#8220;love&#8221; becomes a workplace game.</p>
<div id="attachment_7850" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Love-Week-2015-MV.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7850" src="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Love-Week-2015-MV.jpg" alt="Love Week 2015 MV" width="600" height="293" srcset="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Love-Week-2015-MV.jpg 794w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Love-Week-2015-MV-300x147.jpg 300w, http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Love-Week-2015-MV-622x304.jpg 622w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Happy moments&#8221; from Mindvalley&#8217;s Love Week in 2014 :-)</p></div>
<p>Love Week takes place the week before Valentine&#8217;s, during which every person participating becomes a Secret Angel to another anonymously (similar to the concept of Secret Santa). This year, it takes place from <strong>Monday, February 9th – Friday, February 13th</strong>. Mindvalley wants you to get your company to join in on this global movement. Warning – this will shift your company culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone gives. And everyone receives. The culture is incredibly simple yet it creates an immense, positive cultural shift in the company. And what&#8217;s even more remarkable is that the friendships and bonds continue long after Love Week ends, and in turn so do the positive boosts in productivity,&#8221; adds Vishen.</p>
<p>The week-long campaign will be shared across Mindvalley&#8217;s Facebook page and Instagram and Twitter feeds (@mindvalley) using the official hashtag <strong>#SpreadLoveWeek</strong>, featuring Mindvalley&#8217;s own experience of the culture as well as participating companies and teams across the planet that use the hashtag.</p>
<p><strong>Head over to <a href="http://www.mindvalley.com/culture/love-week" target="_blank">the official Love Week</a> campaign page to find out how you can participate in this global movement to shift company cultures worldwide. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Building a world-class customer support team is not an easy task.</strong></p>
<p>Before you start hiring, training, and planning your strategy, you must first have a clear understanding of the values of your customers. At Mindvalley, the customer experience is a top priority since our programs aim to bring about a positive transformation into people’s lives.</p>
<p>And this can make things very personal.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve accepted this challenge of digging deep into what our customers value in order to craft their experience in such a way that they feel completely supported throughout their journey of self-improvement and enlightenment.</p>
<p>This challenge becomes a herculean task when your customers come from virtually all over the world.</p>
<p>What we discovered was that our customers have very different notions of what ‘great service’ means, and that is partly due to the fact that they come from over 100 different countries; from the U.S. to Russia, Botswana to the Philippines, and Iceland to Colombia.</p>
<p>This extensive diversity presents us with yet another challenge: How do we provide amazing customer service to such a diverse audience?</p>
<p>The answer was presented to us also in the form of diversity.</p>
<p><strong>13 different countries are now represented in our Customer Support Team here in Kuala Lumpur.</strong></p>
<p>That means 13 languages, cultures and values represented in this team, brought together to provide memorable experiences to our customers. We also have amazing agents working from <a href="http://www.mindvalley.com/blog/customerlove/motherhood-transformed-customer-support-centre-costa-rica/" target="_blank">Costa Rica</a>, to offer swift support over the phone to customers with more urgent needs.</p>
<p>As a result of this concerted effort to provide our customers with top-notch service, we have seen an increase in the number of responses from people who have been eager to let us know just how important Mindvalley’s personalized approach to the customer experience is to them.</p>
<p>Some of our customers, like Daniel &#8211; who received support by our Greek agent Zetta &#8211; found the support sincere and graceful:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By far the best customer service experience I&#8217;ve had to date. Not only did Zetta solve the issue, <strong>she taught me something about being a better human being</strong>, just in the way she handled it. With sincerity and intuitive grace. It was humbling to say the least. And very much appreciated. Daniel&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Others, like Julie, found their experience with Brett &#8211; our resident Canadian in the support team – faith-restoring.</p>
<p>Daniel and Julie are just two of the thousands of customers that we interact with every month, and we are constantly innovating in order to surprise, move and wow in every single interaction.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Hi my name is Julie and I am definitely wowed by the support person, Brett, that I have dealt with. Amazing customer service that far exceeds anything I have ever seen in my entire 43 years on this planet<strong>. I not only was supported but have a new hope in my life and for humanity in general.</strong> I am hoping to get ahead so that I may give back what was given. Way to go Mindvalley! And deepest thanks to an amazing support person, Brett. Many blessings to you&#8230;&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>We want to make every customer feel as special as Daniel and Julie, so this month we would love to hear from you.</p>
<p><strong>Let us know what you love about Mindvalley, how we can improve your experience or even just what changes you have planned for your New Year.</strong></p>
<p>And remember, the next time you write to us, you can be sure our rockstar team will wow your day! You can write to us in Greek, English, Tamil, Sinhala, Spanish, French, Russian, Romanian, Arabic, Estonian, Mandarin, Portuguese and Malay, through our support e-mail: <a href="mailto:support@mindvalley.com">support@mindvalley.com</a></p>
<p>If you are a customer from Mindvalley Italy (<a href="mailto:support@mindvalleyitaly.com">support@mindvalleyitaly.com</a>) or Mindvalley Russia (<a href="mailto:support@mindvalleyrussia.com">support@mindvalleyrussia.com</a>), don&#8217;t hesitate to contact them directly for personalized attention.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the reason why we dedicate so much thought and energy into this process is to make sure our customers go on the best possible journey with Mindvalley, and to be able to, ultimately, achieve our goal of pushing humanity forward, one life-changing experience at a time.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by the story of a co-worker's mother, Mindvalley decided to dedicate its Customer Support Centre in Costa Rica Rica to hiring stay-at-home mothers. And the result has been nothing short of remarkable :-)</p>

<p>The people we hire for our team often have amazing life stories and experiences of their own, and we love discovering these because of how it has shaped them as individuals, led them to our door and put them side by side with our mission to help people lead happier lives and be extraordinary.</p>
<p><strong>A few years back we decided to expand our Customer Support team and open a support center in Costa Rica. </strong></p>
<p>Costa Rica is a hotbed for customer support centers with even major companies like Amazon.com having teams there.</p>
<p>But when we opened up applications we noticed an interesting pattern. A lot of the candidates who applied were single moms. They were attracted to our jobs because we allowed people to work from home.</p>
<p>We hired these moms. But to be honest, we really didn&#8217;t think it was going to work out. How could a work from home mother who also had a kid to take care of compete in Customer Services scores against our service stuff who worked from other locations in professional offices.</p>
<p>We assumed the Costa Rican hires would be comparatively unproductive, because we assumed that being a stay-at-home mother meant that you would be prone to distraction and are occupied with what naturally comes first – the children.</p>
<p>But what unfolded proved our assumptions wrong.</p>
<p>These mothers who worked from home, while simultaneously taking care of their children, actually outperformed fulltime Customer Support Teams that are based in an office. At that time we scored all our agents based on a metric called the <em>Awesomeness Quotient. </em>It was a metric measuring emails answered multiplied by customer satisfaction scores using a polling service called NiceReply.com.</p>
<p>In BOTH metrics our moms outperformed regular 9-5 office workers.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that these moms had outdated laptops. They worked from home while our regular staff worked from a Mindvalley HQ, an office that was mentioned in Inc Magazine in 2012 as one of the World&#8217;s Coolest Workplaces. Plus they were also taking care of their kids.</p>
<p>Yet in every metric they outperformed.</p>
<p><strong>We&#8217;re not absolutely sure why our experiment worked, but what we learned was this:</strong></p>
<p>1. It&#8217;s important to trust the people you invest in. Why do we insist that people work around a 9-5 or report to a office to clock in? Perhaps the 9-to-5 work setting is merely an illusion. What if all employees could chose to work their own hours?</p>
<p>2. Motivated employees can easily juggle work and family. It&#8217;s a mistake to underestimate a man or women who is dedicated to their job yet has a child to raise.</p>
<p>3. Changing the concept of &#8220;Customer Support&#8221; to &#8220;Customer Experience&#8221; is key. We asked our moms to treat every customer as their personal angel. This means no copy and paste answers but actual meaningful personalized replies. We asked them to inject love and care into their emails. Perhaps there was some quality about being a mom that helped fuel this. Because within a few months customers began writing back claiming that we had blown them away with our level of service. Almost every week we have customers writing in to call us the &#8216;best customer service they have received in their lifetime&#8217; from an American company.</p>
<p>Comments like this became frequent:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have never, in my 70 years, experienced an organisation/concept/group of people who write in such a positive and uplifting way that you actually feel better after reading their emails&#8230;..and I did not feel bad before I read the email !!!!! Thank you &#8211; Christine Naughton</p></blockquote>
<p>As a company, we feel as if we&#8217;ve hit gold – we now have a Customer Support Team that ranks in the Top 2% of companies that use Nice Reply with a 9.5/10 score.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But more importantly, we are impacting and changing the lives of our Costa Rica Moms, enabling them to raise their children fulltime, while still delivering quality work and service to our customers from home.</p>
<p>On that note, we dedicate this post to these amazing women, and all working mothers out there who are motivated to provide for their family and set a fine example for their children by being the superwomen they are. Costa Rica Moms – thank you for transforming our customer experience :-)</p>
<p>Here are some of our &#8220;Customer support moms&#8221; in Costa Rica and the glowing comments they have received from customers for our programs like Omvana.com and MindvalleyAcademy.com</p>
